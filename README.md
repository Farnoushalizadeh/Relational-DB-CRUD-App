# Relational-DB-CRUD-App
Full-stack University Management System featuring a robust RDBMS backend. Designed complex ER schemas to manage students, courses, and exams. Includes secure CRUD operations, data sanitization, and relational integrity via PHP and MySQL. Developed to showcase database architecture and infrastructure skills.
# University Management System (Full-Stack CRUD Application)

## 📌 Project Overview
A comprehensive web-based management system designed to handle university operations, including student enrollment, course management, professor assignments, and exam scoring. This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** integrated with a dynamic PHP backend.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Full CRUD Functionality:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities across 8 interconnected data entities.
- **Relational Data Integrity:** Managed complex relationships between Students, Courses, Departments, and Exams.
- **Automated Grade Management:** Systems to record, update, and track student exam performance and enrollment status.
- **Sanitized Backend Logic:** Implementation of input sanitization and prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Backend:** PHP (Procedural)
- **Database:** MySQL / MariaDB
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Responsive Table Layouts)
- **Tools:** XAMPP, MySQL Workbench

## 📊 Database Architecture (ER Schema)
The system is built on a normalized relational schema including:
- **Student & Enrollment:** Tracking student life cycles.
- **Professor & Department:** Managing faculty hierarchy.
- **Course, Subject, & Exam:** Structuring academic content and evaluations.

## 📂 File Structure
- `index.php`: The main controller handling routing, form processing, and dynamic UI rendering.
- `DB.php`: Centralized database connection configuration.
- `sql/`: (Recommended) Add your `.sql` export file here.

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the `university_db.sql` file into your local MySQL server.
3. Update `DB.php` with your local database credentials.
4. Run via a local server (XAMPP/WAMP).
